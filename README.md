This code is constantly getting bigger and added on to. I made "Parameter_Sweep_2" because anything further than the latest iteration of the original may
be cumbersome for how specific we are about to get

Each "Paameter_Sweep_...." variation adds a new mode/thing, like making static volcano plots or dynamic volcanos
